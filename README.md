# Overview 
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of GDP per capita data for various countries, focusing on trend analysis, comparative analysis, growth rate analysis, cross-country correlation, and economic growth classification. The project includes visualizations to help interpret the data and understand economic trends on a global scale.

# Contents
***Trend Analysis***

**Individual Country Analysis:** Examines the GDP per capita trends for individual countries over time. This analysis provides insights into how the GDP per capita of each country has evolved over the years.
Global Average GDP per Capita Analysis: Analyzes the global average GDP per capita to identify overall trends and patterns.

***Comparative Analysis***

**Top vs. Bottom Performers:** Compares the GDP per capita of the top-performing and bottom-performing countries over time. This analysis highlights significant differences and trends between the highest and lowest performers.

***Growth Rate Analysis***

**Annual Growth Rate:** Calculates the annual growth rate of GDP per capita for each country to understand yearly changes.

***Cross-Country Correlation Analysis***

**Correlation of Growth Rates:** Analyzes if the GDP per capita growth in one country correlates with growth in another. This provides insights into global economic relationships.

***Economic Growth Classification***

**Classification into High, Stable, and Low Growth:** Classifies countries based on their average annual GDP per capita growth into categories such as High-Growth, Stable, and Low-Growth.
Interactive World Map: Displays the classified countries on an interactive world map to visualize global economic growth patterns.

# Data
The dataset includes GDP per capita data for various countries from 1970 to 2022. The data is organized in a format where each row represents a country, and columns represent GDP per capita for each year.

# Requirements
Python 3.x

Libraries: pandas, numpy, plotly

# Usage
***Load the Dataset:*** Read the GDP per capita data into a pandas DataFrame.

**Perform Analyses:**

***Trend Analysis:*** Generate plots for individual country trends and global averages.

***Comparative Analysis:*** Create comparative plots for top and bottom performers.

***Growth Rate Analysis:*** Compute and plot annual and compound growth rates.

***Cross-Country Correlation:*** Analyze and visualize correlations between countries.

***Economic Growth Classification:*** Classify countries and visualize the results on an interactive world map.
